# Dataset Analyzer and Linear Regression Model

This project performs dataset analysis and fits a linear regression model to help understand relationships between variables.

## Features

- Analyze key statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, etc.).
- Handle missing values and generate visualizations (e.g., scatterplots, heatmaps).
- Fit a linear regression model with customizable parameters.
- Output detailed metrics including R-squared, MSE, and residuals.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - SciPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
  - Seaborn
  - tqdm
